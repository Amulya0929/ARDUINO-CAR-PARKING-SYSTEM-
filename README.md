# ARDUINO-CAR-PARKING-SYSTEM-
Introducing Automated Car Parking Systems based on IoT,This project detects the empty slots and helps the drivers to find parking space in unfamiliar city.



Nowadays in many multiple systems there is a severe problem with car parking
systems. There are many lanes for car parking so to park a car one has to look for
the all lanes. Moreover there is a lot of manual labour involved for this process
for which there is lot of investment. So the need is to develop a system which
Indicates directly which parking slot is vacant in any lane. The project involves a
system including infrared trummitor and receiver in every lane and a LED display
guide the car parking game. So the person entering parking area can view the
LED display and can decide which lane to enter so as to park the car Car park-
ing systems does not have any intelligent monitoring system. All vehicles enter
into the parking and waste time for searching for parking slot. Sometimes it cre-
ates blockage Condition become worse when there are multiple parking lanes and
each lane have multiple parking-slots. Use of automated system for car parking
monitoring will reduce the human effort Display unit is installed on entrance of
parking slot which will show LEDs for all Parking slot and for all parking lanes.
When a car arrives it opens the gate only when there are empty spaces lent. If the
empty slot is not available then the gate does not open. Basically, you increment
the count every time a car comes in and decrement when it goes out. The LED
in the system simply indicates that the vehicle is properly counted as it lights on
every time a car passes through a IR Sensor.
